# Polymorphism & Composition Homework - Quiz

# Polymorphism


1. What does the ___word___ 'polymorphism' mean?

Poly, is many. And morph is to change. So something that has many different forms


2. What does it mean when we apply polymorphism to OO design? Give a simple Java example.

   We can have an Animal superclass, the animal cat inherits all its classes. We can now create a 
   New animal using the cat constructor.


3. What can we use to implement polymorphism in Java?

   We can add different object types to an array.


4. How many 'forms' can an object take when using polymorphism?

   As many as we have implemented.


5. Give an example of when you could use polymorphism.

   You could have an Animal array with all our animals inside. We can now loop through our
   whole animal collection, and use any method in the super.


# Composition

6. What do we mean by 'composition' in reference to object-oriented programming?

7. When would you use composition? Provide a simple example in Java.

   You could have pc component parts within a pc object, and you can instantiate the parts
   then, when you instantiate the pc object, you have all the components inside that object, the
   Pc master object can now access all the component methods. 


8. What is/are the advantage(s) of using composition?

   You gain access to the full set of methods of any class its implemented.
   You can have multiple objects use the components.
